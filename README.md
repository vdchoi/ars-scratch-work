(1992). Our deliverable is an R package that allows the user to provide a probability density function with its domain, and the required number of points. The main function of our package returns samples from that probability density function. Formal testing is included, in the main function as well as the subparts that are being called during its execution. Basic doc strings and comments are provided for all lower-level functions. Standard R documentation is being provided for the primary function.
